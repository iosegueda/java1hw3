<h2></h2>
<p>The electric company charges according to the following rate schedule:</p>
<p>9 cents per kilowatt-hour (kwh) for the first 300 kwh <br /> 8 cents per kwh for the next 300 kwh (up to 600 kwh) <br /> 6 cents per kwh for the next 400 kwh (up to 1000 kwh) <br /> 5 cents per kwh for all electricity used over 1000 kwh</p>
<p>Write a program that would repeatedly read in a customer number (an integer) and the usage for that customer in kwh (an integer). The program should include a method to compute the total charge for each customer. Use the following template for the method:</p>
<pre>// takes kwh and calculates the total charge for that customer. 

public static double findCharge(int kwh){
	// put your code here
}

</pre>
<p>The program should terminate when the user enters a sentinel value of -999 for the customer number. The program should print a three-column chart listing the customer number, the kilowatt-hours used, and the total charge for each customer. The program should also compute and print the number of customers, the total kilowatt-hours used, and the total charges. Use a <tt>JTextArea</tt> component within a <tt>JOptionPane</tt> dialog box to display the output. You should name the source code file <tt>Hw3.java</tt>.</p>
<p>Note that you should not use arrays for this assignment.</p>
